// Overall master volume shift; this is meant to be a precision value and does not affect
// actual output volumes.  It converts SPU2 16 bit volumes to 32-bit volumes, and likewise
// downsamples 32 bit samples to 16 bit sound driver output (this way timestretching and
// DSP effects get better precision results)
#define SND_OUT_VOLUME_SHIFT 12
#define SND_OUT_VOLUME_SHIFT32 4 // shift up, not down, (formula = 16 - SND_OUT_VOLUME_SHIFT)
